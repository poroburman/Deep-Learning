# Deep-Learning

This Guthub repository has all the projects which I've worked on Deep Learning.   

1. Convolutional Neural Network: This script uses Recurrent Neural Network to predict the trend in Facebook's stock price. Following files are part of this project:    
                            - RNN.ipynb - python script for this analysis.             
                            - cat_or_dog_1.jpg - image to predict.     

2. Artificial Neural Network: This script uses ANN to analyze and predicts which customers continue to keep their accounts within a specific bank and which customers leave the bank.The dataset contains the details of all the customers within a bank. Following files are part of this project:
                            - ANN - Classification.   
                            - Churn_Modelling.csv : dataset.
